Chapter 1- A Tutorial Introduction [
    (i) Hello World: 
        #include <stdio.h>

        main() 
        {
            printf("hello, world");
        }

        A C program, whatever its size, consists of functions and variables. A function consists of functions and variables. 
        A function contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done. and variables store values used during the
        computation.

        Any program begins executing at the beginning of `main`. This means that every program must have a `main` somewhere.

        `#include <stdio.h>`, This tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library ; the line
        appears at the beginning of many source files.

        One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values , called 
        `arguments`, to the function it calls. The Parenthesis after the function name surround the argument list,

        #include <stdio.h> -->  include information about standard library.
        main()  -->  define a function called main that recieved no arguments values
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");  -->  statements of main are enclosed in braces, main calls library function printf to print
                                            this sequence of characters. \n represents the newline character
        }

        `printf` is a library function that prints output, in this case the string of characters between the quotes.
        A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a character string or string constant.
        The sequence \n in the string is C notation for the `newline character`, which when printed advances the output to
        the left margin on the next line.
