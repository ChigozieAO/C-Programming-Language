The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

Introduction into C

Chapters and their Exercises

-Chapter 1
1: Run the "hello, world" program on your machine (hello.c);
2: Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table (temp-conversion-2.c);
3: Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table (temp-conversion-3.c);
4: Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0
(temp-conversion-reverse.c);
5: Write a program to print the value of EOF (get-char.c);
6: Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines (tab-blanks-line-count.c)
7: Write a program to copy input to output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank
(input-output-blank-replace.c)
8: Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each
backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an
unambiguous way (inp-out-replace-tab-slash.c)
9: Write a program that prints its input one word per line (one-word-line.c)
10: Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function
for conversion. (FahrToCels-func.c)
