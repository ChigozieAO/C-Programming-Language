Introduction into C

Chapters and their Exercises

-Chapter 1
1: Run the "hello, world" program on your machine (hello.c);
2: Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table (temp-conversion-2.c);
3: Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table (temp-conversion-3.c);
4: Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0
(temp-conversion-reverse.c);
5: Write a program to print the value of EOF (get-char.c);
6: Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines (tab-blanks-line-count.c)
7: Write a program to copy input to output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank
(input-output-blank-replace.c)
8: Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each
backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an
unambiguous way (inp-out-replace-tab-slash.c)
9: Write a program that prints its input one word per line (one-word-line.c)
10: Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function
for conversion. (FahrToCels-func.c)
11: Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the
length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as possible of the text (printLongestAndLen.c).
12 : Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters (printInputLongerThan80.c).
13 : Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and
to delete entirely blank lines (removeBlankTabsSpace.c).
14 : Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s. Use it to
write a program that reverses its input a line at a time (reverseTheCharacter.c).
15 : Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number
of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns.
Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter? (detab.c).
16 : Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number
of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab. When
either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given
preference? (entab.c).
