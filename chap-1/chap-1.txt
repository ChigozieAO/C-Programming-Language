Chapter 1- A Tutorial Introduction [
    (i) Hello World: 

        #include <stdio.h>

        main() 
        {
            printf("hello, world");
        }

        A C program, whatever its size, consists of functions and variables. A function consists of functions and variables. 
        A function contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done. and variables store values used during the
        computation.

        Any program begins executing at the beginning of `main`. This means that every program must have a `main` somewhere.

        `#include <stdio.h>`, This tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library ; the line
        appears at the beginning of many source files.

        One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values , called 
        `arguments`, to the function it calls. The Parenthesis after the function name surround the argument list,

        #include <stdio.h> -->  include information about standard library.
        main()  -->  define a function called main that recieved no arguments values
        {
            printf("hello, world\n");  -->  statements of main are enclosed in braces, main calls library function printf to print
                                            this sequence of characters. \n represents the newline character
        }

        `printf` is a library function that prints output, in this case the string of characters between the quotes.
        A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a character string or string constant.
        The sequence \n in the string is C notation for the `newline character`, which when printed advances the output to
        the left margin on the next line. 

    (ii) Variables and Arithmetic Expressions: 

         The next program uses the formula C = (5/9) (F-32) to print a table of Fahrenheit temperature and their Celsius Equivalent

         #include <stdio.h>

         /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table for fahr = 0, 20, .., 300*/

         main()
         {
            int fahr, celsius;
            int lower, upper, step;

            lower = 0; /*lower limit of temperature*/
            upper = 300; /* upper limit */
            step = 20; /* step size */

            fahr = lower;
            while (fahr <= upper) {
                celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9;
                printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
                fahr = fahr + step;
            }
         }

         the lines encased in the /* */ are comments, which in this case explains briefly what the program does. Any characters
         between /* */ are ignored by the compiler, they may be used freely to make a program easier to understand.

         In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning of the function before any executable
         statements. A declaration announces the properties of variables; it consists of a name and a list of variables, such as 
            ` int fahr, celsius;
              int lower , upper , step; `
         the type `int` means that the variable listed are integers; by contrast with `float`, which means floating point, ie numbers 
         that may have a fractional part.

         C provides several other data types besides int and float including:
            char  =  character - a single byte
            short   =   short integer
            long    =   long integer
            double  =   double-precision floating point.

         computation in the temperature conversion begins with the assignment statements, which set the variables to their initial
         values. Individual statements are terminated by semi-colons.

         each line of the table is computed the same way, so we use a loop that repeats once per output line, this is the purpose
         of the while loop.

         the while loop operates as follows: the condition in Parenthesisis tested. if it is true (fahr <= upper). the body of the
         loop is executed. then the condition is re-tested, and if true , the body is executed again. when the test is false the loop
         ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows the loop. there are no further statements in this program, so
         it terminates.

         the reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of fast multiplying 5/9 is that in C, as in many other languages
         integer divsion truncates: any fractional part is discarded, since 5 and 9 are integers. 5/9 would be trunccated to zero 
         and so all the celsius temperatures would be reported as zeros.

         printf is a general-purpose output formatting function, its first argument is a string of characters to be pointed, with 
         each % indicating where one of the other arguments is to be substituted, and in what form it is to be printed. for instance,
         %d specifies an integer argument. so the statement:
            printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
         causes the values of the two integers fahr and celsius to be printed, with a tab between them.

         each % construction in the first argument of printf is paired with the corresponding second argument, third argument, etc.
         they must match up properly by number and type, or you will get wrong answers.

         there are a couple of problems with the temperature program. the more serious problem is that because we have used integer
         arithmetic, the celsius temperatures are not very accurate, to get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point
         arithmetic instead of integers.

         A more accurate version is this:
            #include <stdio.h>

            main()
            {
                float fahr, celsius;
                float lower, upper, step;

                lower = 0;
                upper = 0;
                step = 20;

                fahr = lower:
                while (fahr <= upper) {
                    celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);
                    printf("%3.0f%6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
                    fahr = fahr + step;
                }
            }
         
         this is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float and the formula for conversion is
         written in a more natural way.

         the printf conversion specification %3.0f says that a floating-point number is to be printed at least three characters
         wide, with no decimal point and fraction digit. %6.1f describes another number that is to be ptinted at least six
         characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point.

         - %d    =   print as decimal integer
         - %6d   =   print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide.
         - %f   =   print as floating point.
         - %6f  =   print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide.
         - %.2f =   print as floating point, 2 characters after the decimal point.
         - %6.2f  = print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide and 2 after the decimal point.

         * %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character string and %% for itself.

    (iii) The For Statement:

         #include <stdio.h>

         /*print Fahrenheit-Celsius table*/

         main()
         {
            int fahr;

            for (fahr = 0; fahr <= 300; fahr = fahr + 20)
                printf("%3d%6.1f\n", fahr , (5.0/9.0) * (fahr - 32));
         }

         This last change is an instance of a general rule - in any context where it is permissible to use the value of some type,
         you can use a more complicated expression of that type.

         the `for` statement is a loop, a generalization of the while. if you compare it to the earlier while, its operation 
         should be clear.

         the choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clear. the for is usually appropriate for loops in
         which the initialization and increment are single statements together in one place. 

    (iv) Symbolic Constants

         A #define line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters.

         #define name replacement list

         Thereafter any occurence of name (not in qoutes and not part of any name) will be replaced by the corresponding 
         replacement text. the name has the same form as a variable name: a sequence of letters and digits that begins with a 
         letter . the replacement text can be any sequence of characters, it is not limited to numbers.

         #include <stdio.h>

         #define LOWER 0
         #define UPPER 300
         #define STEP 20

         main()
         {
            int fahr;

            for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
                printf("%3d%6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0) * (fahr - 32))
         }

         The quantities LOWER, UPPER and STEP are symbolic constants not variables, so they do not appear in declaratios.
         symbolic constants names are conventionally written in upper case so they can be readily distinguished from lower case
         variable names. Notice that there is no semi-colon at the end of a #define line.
